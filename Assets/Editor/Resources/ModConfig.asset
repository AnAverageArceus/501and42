  description: 'Have you had enough of watching a bunch of numbers to figure out when
    to let go of a button? Well too bad, because now you get even more! And with two
    modules instead of one! *inhale* AND they''re both pseudo-needies that''ll completely
    ruin you! Yippee!


    Oh yeah, they''re also blank modules that''ll strike you if you aren''t careful.
    Sooooo yeah.
